# Cloud Security Pipeline

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a complete, production-grade DevSecOps pipeline for secure deployment of cloud-native applications. The project integrates security best practices, infrastructure-as-code, automated vulnerability scanning, and continuous deployment using a simulated AWS environment. All components are designed to showcase real-world skills in secure cloud automation and application delivery.

## Key Features

- Infrastructure as Code: Automated, repeatable AWS provisioning via Terraform, including support for LocalStack for local validation.
- Vulnerable Reference Application: A purpose-built Python Flask web application designed to test security tooling.
- End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions orchestrate linting, dependency checks, static code analysis, container image scanning, and automated deployment to AWS.
- Automated Dockerized Deployment: Pipeline builds, copies, and deploys the Dockerized application to an EC2 instance using secure, scripted workflows.
- Security Group Hardening: Only essential ports (22 for SSH, 5000 for Flask) are exposed; all other ports are explicitly blocked and verified via custom tooling.
- Port Verification Automation: Custom Python script (`/scripts/port_tester.py`) automatically audits the network configuration after each deployment to ensure adherence to least-privilege principles.
- Cloud Security Controls: Enforced least-privilege IAM roles, secure secrets management, network segmentation, and comprehensive AWS logging and monitoring (CloudTrail, GuardDuty).
- Automated Alerting and Reporting: Pipeline execution halts on any detected vulnerabilities or misconfigurations; security scan and deployment logs are generated for auditability.
- Automated Security Scan Reports: The `/reports` directory stores the latest Bandit (Python) and Trivy (Docker) scan results and deployment logs generated by the CI/CD pipeline. Reports are overwritten on each deployment to provide an up-to-date audit record of system security.

## Technology Stack

- Cloud Provider: AWS
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Application: Python Flask (intentionally vulnerable)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Security Tools: Bandit, Trivy, pip-audit, AWS CloudTrail, AWS GuardDuty

## Learning Outcomes

- Build and operate secure, automated cloud deployment pipelines using industry-standard technologies.
- Integrate vulnerability and configuration scanning at every stage of development and deployment.
- Enforce cloud security controls through code and verify outcomes with automated tools.
- Monitor, audit, and document security posture throughout the CI/CD process.
- Demonstrate hands-on DevSecOps proficiency for professional portfolios and technical interviews.

Cloud Security Pipeline
Overview

This project demonstrates a secure, automated DevSecOps pipeline for deploying cloud-native applications. It integrates security best practices, infrastructure-as-code, automated vulnerability scanning, and continuous deployment in a simulated AWS environment.
Features

    Infrastructure as Code: Automated provisioning using Terraform (AWS, supports LocalStack for local testing).

    Sample Vulnerable App: Simple Flask (Python) web app for security testing.

    CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions automate linting, dependency checks, static code analysis, container scanning, and deployment.

    Cloud Security Controls: Least-privilege IAM, secure secrets management, network segmentation, and logging/monitoring (CloudTrail, GuardDuty).

    Automated Alerts: Pipeline fails on detected vulnerabilities or misconfigurations; summary reports generated for each build.

Tech Stack

    Cloud: AWS 

    IaC: Terraform

    App: Python Flask (vulnerable demo)

    CI/CD: GitHub Actions

    Security Tools: Bandit, Trivy, pip-audit, AWS CloudTrail/GuardDuty
